#Your process/approach.
  Prior to receiving this exact assignment, I had already been toying with the idea of a game that would help you learn people's names based on our current cohort. Upon receiving the assignment, I chose to create a game rather than a portfolio for two reasons: 1) I already had an idea for a game 2) i wanted to challenge myself to better understand js/jquery and felt this project could provide said opportunity.

  To begin the assignment, I sketched out what I wanted the actual game layout to look like and then determined how to best create it, using bootstrap. I also quickly laid out a very basic understanding of the logic.

  Once my HTML and CSS files were done, I outlined my logic in pseudo code. While I initially wanted each person's "polaroid" to be a separate object created from a JS array, I could not get this to properly work despite my efforts. Therefore, I chose to create a MVP using HTML for the cards and focus the js on the logic behind the games answers.

  I was able to quickly set up the game visually and have it perfectly styled. The part that took significantly longer for me was that of getting the logic to work. Though I knew what I wanted to achieve logically, I struggled in having the code actually work or finding an ideal solution. I definitely had about 32days that were spent just googling different ways to  solve issues I was having that kept breaking my code such as getting my form to properly submit and change the answers, the point calculations, and finding a DRY way to

-When the first player's score is input, the box that contains their score shifts the box with player two's score down
-I created a separate js file which attempts to make each person's polaroid using js arrays so that it can be used for future cohorts. Will be working on this moving forward.

#Your biggest wins and challenges.

Getting the logic behind this game to work and seeing my creative vision come to fruition was a huge win for me!  There were definitely a lot of ups and down, but I'm glad I chose to challenge myself by doing a game and learned a great deal in that process.

The biggest challenge was definitely using JS/Jquery. Part of this was that I couldn't get the DRY version of my code to work so that I didn't need to duplicate code in evaluating right/wrong answers. Though I understood the logic behind it and knew the dry way of evaluating the input.value with with name of said attribute, the multiple iterations I did of this did not work. However, I now have it and can add this to version 2.0. The other challenge was using arrays to create each "polaroid" as well as setting up new functions without ruining the existing ones.

I really enjoy HTML and CSS so that part came more easily for me. That said I chose to use Bootstrap to better familiarize myself with  it though it poses its own challenges.




During this process I came up with the following lessons learned/best practices for the future as well as areas to work on:
    1. Commit more often
    2. Use console log more to test new code or functions
    3. Always indent/organize code as I go
    4. When creating  pseudo code for js don't just do one part, but write out logic beginning to end of game in case you later realize another setup would have been easier but would have needed to be implemented sine the beginning.
    5. Become more comfortable with gitHub. (I still used usbs or made more than one version of a document since I don't know how to revert to older version on gitHub)
